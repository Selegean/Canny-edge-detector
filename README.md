# Canny Edge Detector

This project implements the **Canny edge detection algorithm** using OpenCV in Python. The Canny algorithm is a multi-stage edge detection technique that is widely used in image processing tasks to identify sharp changes in intensity, which represent edges in the image.

## Features
- Reads and processes an input image.
- Converts the image to grayscale.
- Applies Gaussian blur to reduce noise.
- Uses the Canny algorithm to detect edges.
- Displays the original and edge-detected images side by side for comparison.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you'll need the following libraries:
- `opencv-python`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `jupyter`

You can install these dependencies with pip:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib jupyter
